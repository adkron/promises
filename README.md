# Promise
This is not production code (at the moment). It is a conceptual demo.
Slides for the accompanying presentation are [here](http://dinshaw.github.io/promises-sildes).

* For this implementation, 'resolve' chooses between 'fulfillment' (success) and 'rejection' (failure)

## Installation
Clone this repo.
Run `rake install`
Then in irb, you should be able to `require 'promise'`

## Usage
See `/demo`
