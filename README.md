# Promise

resolve:
1. settle or find a solution to (a problem, dispute, or contentious matter).
2. decide firmly on a course of action.

fulfill:
1. bring to completion or reality; achieve or realize (something desired, promised, or predicted).

For our context, 'resolve' chooses between 'fulfillment' (success) and 'rejection' (failure)
